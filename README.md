A website developed for the Light Hall Software Engineering Super League. The webiste has a clickable button and a click count. Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number should reflect all previous clicks. That means, refreshing the page should not reset the count to 0 or any other default number.
